# CTODO â€” Little *UNFINISHED* program made with cassete cgui

This program is really unfinished, and more of a practice for me before making a real app using this library

### What you can find here:
- A bit of input handling, only the shift key
- The way to swap grids (because there is no such an example project in original cassette repository </3)
- And other nerdy C array, memory, pointers stuff

### Implemented:
- Changing status (For now only 2 statuses: ND - "Not Done" and D - "Done")
- Deleting ToDo values (Shift + Click on status button)
- Adding new ones (Since I didn't implement typing yet, they have placeholder name of "Implement typing!! {index + 1}"

### Not Implemented:
- Typing, renaming, and all text related stuff (That means that there is only the hardcoded and the "Implement typing!!" todo values)
- Pages (May never implement it, if you want more than 7 values, feel free to fork this repository and change grid row count)
